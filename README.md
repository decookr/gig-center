# Gig Center

A full stack web application to help bands and musicians manage details for upcoming gigs. Solves the problem of having to sort through and locate pieces of information in multiple locations (long email chains, text messages, etc.). Users can log into the app and immediately see the events theyâ€™ve been scheduled for. They can select a specific gig to view the details. Gigs can also be added and specific band members can be scheduled for that gig. Song lists can also be added to a gig from a database of songs.
